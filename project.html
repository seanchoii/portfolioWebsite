    <p class = "bubbleSign" id = "bubblePixelAdventure" style = "display: none;">Pixel Adventure is a fun little game that I made with graphic images created by 
        Pixel Frog. <br><br>
        I coded this game in Dart language, and used an open source framework by Google called Flutter to run the application on chrome
        (It can be run on many other platforms). 
        I have also implemented the use of the Flame Game engine that provides a complete set of unique solutions for games.

    <p class = "bubbleSign" id = "mywebsite" style = "display: none;">Personal portfolio website that I made using HTML/CSS and Javascript. <br><br>
        I constructed this website to look like a Windows OS Design. This design is visually appealing and unique from other
        portfolio website designs.

    <p class = "bubbleSign" id = "tottenhamP" style = "display: none;"> The powerpoint contains information about last ten years of the England's 
        football club Tottenham Hotspurs F.C<br><br> It contains information about their financial spending, attendance, players, etc..
        The information is presented in Microsoft Power B.I, which displays sets of data in reports and dashboards.

        My personal food review application created using React. If you do not know where to eat out in Calgary, use my application to find your restaurant for the night!
        <br><br>
        Mapped out restaurants using Google Maps API and each restaurants are marked by food icons. If the icons are clicked, 
        it will pop a brutally honest food review on that restaurant
