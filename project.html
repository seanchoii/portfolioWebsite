    <p class = "bubbleSign" id = "bubblePixelAdventure">Pixel Adventure is a fun little game that I made with graphic images created by 
        Pixel Frog. <br><br>
        I coded this game in Dart language, and used an open source framework by Google called Flutter to run the application on chrome
        (It can be run on many other platforms). 
        I have also implemented the use of the Flame Game engine that provides a complete set of unique solutions for games.

    <p class = "bubbleSign" id = "mywebsite">Personal portfolio website that I made using HTML/CSS and Javascript. <br><br>
        I constructed this website to look like a Windows OS Design. This design is visually appealing and unique from other
        portfolio website designs.

    <p class = "bubbleSign" id = "tottenhamP"> The powerpoint contains information about last ten years of the England's 
        football club Tottenham Hotspurs F.C<br><br> It contains information about their financial spending, attendance, players, etc..
        The information is presented in Microsoft Power B.I, which displays sets of data in reports and dashboards.
